# Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic


Network security is critical in an era where computer networks are the core of many
activities. Organizations across industries face the ongoing challenge of safeguarding their
networks against various possible threats, including malware infiltrations, illegal access,
and data breaches. Traditional defenses, like firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
provide some protection against recognized attacks, but they frequently fail to address
emerging and growing hazards.
The focus has switched increasingly to Machine Learning techniques to address this
critical challenge. These advanced algorithms can examine massive amounts of network
traffic data, identifying unnatural patterns that may indicate forthcoming security threats.
Algorithms excel at detecting deviations from regular network activity by extracting in-
sights from past data and learning from previous instances, allowing for early danger
detection and preventive response. Reducing false positives allows security teams to focus
their resources on legitimate threats, significantly increasing effectiveness.
The main goal is to test different approaches to anomaly detection and choose the most appropri-
ate one on the given dataset. This investigation will need careful testing and comparison to
find the most appropriate approach.
